# Wave-Project
Optical  imaging  has  often  been  use  to  take  measurements  of  ocean  properties.  With  the  development  of  new and  more  efficient  methodologies  as  well  as  cheaper  technology to  perform  them,  it  is  now  possible  to  perform  an  advanced analysis  in  real-time  with  inexpensive  tools.  This  can  help  the already existing sensors used to measure the quality of the ocean at any  given time for the  beach-goers that would  like to  know such  things.

To demonstrate this, we extend the multiwavetracking PythonLibrary which was previously implemented in the   GitHub project <https://github.com/citrusvanilla/multiplewavetracking_py>. In particular, we added parameters to detect

- Wavelength
- Period
- Speed
- Temporal Frequency

Also we modified the approach of measuring waves and refused of detecting potential waves. Uses OpenCV to detect and measure properties of ocean waves. Further work will involve making the calculations more robust and less dependent on predefined parameters.
